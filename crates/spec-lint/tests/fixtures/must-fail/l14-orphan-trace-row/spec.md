# l14-orphan-trace-row — a trace row joining to nothing

Status: proposed
Governs: silent-factory-worklists/l14-orphan-trace-row.json
Consumers: the spec-lint must-fail corpus test
Supersedes: none

## Outcome

This spec exists to fail one rule class. Every other rule passes over it. The
corpus test counts the defect it produces. The break is in the trace beside it
rather than in these bytes: one row traces a claim this file never declares,
which is the join asserting a lineage that does not exist.

## Vocabulary

- corpus spec (NEW) — the deliberately broken spec this file is.

## Rulings

| id | decision | ruling |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | breakage | this corpus spec breaks one rule class |

## Claims

### R1 — the single breakage
Why: one broken rule per file keeps the defect map readable.
1.1 the linter reads this corpus spec → the run reports the named defect (given). [gate: cargo-tests]

## Unchanged

Omitted: the corpus spec changes nothing.

## Unknowns

Omitted: no doubt outstanding.

## Stages

Omitted: the corpus spec is not built.

## Forbidden

F.1 Do not repair this file.
